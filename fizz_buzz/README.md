* create a README.md with the instruction on how to run your solution
* see Matthew_Harris as an example

### Cheating
* Yes you can look at others peoples solutions
* Yes you can use google
* Yes you can use Stack Over Flow
* in our interview we will talk about your code
* it would be awkward if yours matches someone else's
  * unless its the basic solution
  * you can talk us through the code
