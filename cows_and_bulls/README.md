### Problem

The cows and bulls game, Player 1 chooses a word and player 2 guesses the word. 
You say bulls when a character in the player 2's guess match with a character in player 1's word and also it is in the correct position as in 1's word. 
You say cows, when a character in the player 2's word match the character in player 1, but it is not in the correct position. 
The characters are case insensitive. 
Given two words player 1 and player 2,
Write a function that return the number of bulls and number of cows. For example,

Player 1: The word: {{input}}

Player 2: The guess: {{input}}

bulls - 0, cows - 4 

Play again? [Y/n]

Player 1: The word: {{input}}

Player 2: The guess: {{input}}

Play again? [Y/n]

Good Bye!
